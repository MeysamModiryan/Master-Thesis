# Train Re-schedule During Locomotive Disruption
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my master's thesis, "Train Re-schedule During Locomotive Disruption." This project addresses the critical issue of train timetable rescheduling when locomotive disruptions occur, and it has significant implications for optimizing railway operations.

# Overview
**Thesis Title:** Train Re-schedule During Locomotive Disruption  
**Problem Description:** This research focuses on the rescheduling of train timetables during locomotive disruptions, which are common in the railway industry.  
# Key Highlights
**Solution Approach:** I developed a sophisticated Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model to tackle the problem efficiently.  
**Solver Used:** The MIP model was implemented and solved using GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System), a powerful optimization tool.  
**Real-World Application:** The model's effectiveness was demonstrated by solving a real-time problem within the Iran railway system.  
**Remarkable Outcomes:** By implementing this model, we managed to significantly reduce delay times by more than 60%, highlighting its practical relevance and efficiency.  
# Repository Contents
**Code:** This repository contains the code and scripts related to the MIP model and its implementation using GAMS.  
**Data:** Relevant datasets and input files used in the experiments.  
**Documentation:** Any additional documentation or research papers related to this thesis.  
**Results:** A summary of the results obtained from the model, showcasing the improvements in train schedule rescheduling.
